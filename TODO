Here's a list of things we need to do (contributions are welcome and highly
appreciated, please also read Documentation/SubmittingPatches about how to
submit your contributions, items marked with '!' are of high importance):

 0! Improve manpages, extend the documentation or write useful howtos.
	@TODO: Jon Schipp, Daniel Borkmann

 1! Highest prio: Cleanup and refactor the code and build system to make it
    more maintainable, stable, and probably faster! mausezahn: clean it up
    add fork + fanout mode, remove libpcap dependency, let it also store
    pcap files e.g. on a network filesystem of the mausezahn box.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

 3! Add full IPv6 support for flowtop, test IPv6 on curvetun and mausezahn.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

 5) Make trafgen also write to a pcap instead to a device.

 6) Let netsniff-ng and trafgen support pcap and pcap-ng!

10! Add a proper 802.11 dissector for netsniff-ng.
	@TODO: Markus Amend

12) Add new dissectors (e.g. BGP, DNS, DCCP, SCTP, RSVP, IPsec, LISP, RADIUS,
    LLC, fix MPLS?, improve ARP, BPDU, PVST, CDP, LLDP, RTP, Syslog, NTP,
    OpenFlow, ...), add new protocols to mausezahn.

13! Easier language (bpf-hla) for /fast/ filtering (e.g. on top of BPF so
    that it can run in the kernel), include this into bpfc (bpfc-hla).
	@TODO: Tobias Kalbitz, Markus Amend

16) Further micro-optimize netsniff-ng, trafgen, mausezahn's performance. Use
    Oprofile for optimize tools!

17) Security review of curvetun.

21) Obfuscate curvetun's protocol to make it hard/resource-intensive for DPIs.

22! Add different timing models to trafgen, not just a static interpacket gap.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

24) Do we need TPACKETV2 or even TPACKETV3 if it is eventually implemented?

25) Do performance tests with 10 Gigabit cards.

28! Remove liburcu dependency from flowtop.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

29) Improve the Linux kernel's net/packet/af_packet.c (that we rely on)

30! Fix UDP+TCP tracking in flowtop.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

31) astraceroute: implement DNS traceroute with AS/Geo information

32) ifpps: add option for --dev eth0,eth1,eth2 and accumulate stats

33) flowtop: can we get per socket pps, bytes per sec without sniffing?

34) Are there other interesting (e.g. ethtool) stats for ifpps?

35) Build a generic interface that is somewhat transparant to RX_RING/TX_RING
    where we can user uio-dma, integrate uio-ixgbe and probably port others.
    This could be invoked through a special build option. Default should always
    be RX_RING / TX_RING.

    [2] http://pub.netsniff-ng.org/misc/uio-ixgbe.tar.bz2

37! netsniff-ng has a build-dependency on libnl-dev [1]. libnl-1.x is no longer
    actively developed [2] and has been superseded by libnl-3.x [3]. Please
    port netsniff-ng to this new version resp. notify upstream to get
    netsniff-ng updated. One of the major changes in v3 is that the library was
    split into several smaller libraries. You can find a developer' guide and
    API documentation for each library at [2].

    [3] http://packages.qa.debian.org/libn/libnl3.html
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

38! netsniff-ng (and others): if interface goes down, properly exit
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

39! Add a pcap indxeing utility fo a faster retrival, analysis on huge
    pcap files. Write the index file out for each pcap capture.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann

40! Give more than just a one-line description of each tool on the website.
    Probably, a new section after Abstract might help.
	@TODO: Daniel Borkmann
