=head1 NAME

build_nacl - build NaCl in the wanted build directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

build_nacl <nacl_build_path>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script was written to faciliate NaCl building and
integration in the netsniff-g toolkit infrastructure.

It unpacks the content of contrib/nacl/nacl-20110221.tar.bz2
in the given build directory, builds it and output the path
to NaCl library and its header in nacl_path.cmake.

The following file is then included by CMake to find NaCl
for the linking operation.
