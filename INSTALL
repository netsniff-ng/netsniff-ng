Currently only operating systems running on Linux kernels with
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP enabled. This feature can be found even back
to the days of 2.4 kernels. Most operating systems ship pre-compiled
kernels that have this config option enabled and even the latest
kernel versions got rid of this option and have this functionality
already built-in. However, we recommend a kernel >= 2.6.31, because
the TX_RING is officially integrated since then.

netsniff-ng has been successfully tested on x86 and x86_64. Please drop
us a short mail, if it runs successfully on hardware other than that.
We assume, it will run, but unfortunately, we don't have other hardware
than that.

What libraries / tools are required?

 - libc (all)
 - cmake (all)
 - libpthread (curvetun, netsniff-ng)
 - libncurses (ifpps)
 - libGeoIP and its database (ashunt)
 - flex, bison (bpfc)
 - libnacl (curvetun)

It is common, that these libraries are shipped as distribution packages
for an easy installation. We try to keep this as minimal as possible.

The installation process done by cmake is fairly simple:

  $ cd netsniff-ng/src/
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  # make install

To uninstall, simply remove all files refered in install_manifest.txt

In order to build curvetun, libnacl must be built first.
However, an helper script called build_nacl.sh is there to facilitate the process.
If you want to build NaCl in the directory ~/nacl, the script should be called this way:

  $ cd src/curvetun
  $ ./build_nacl.sh ~/nacl

If NaCl already has been built on the target, it is quicker to use nacl_path.sh this way:
  $ cd src/curvetun
  $ ./nacl_path.sh ~/nacl/build/include/x86 ~/nacl/build/lib/x86

When done, netsniff-ng build infrastructure will read nacl_path.cmake to get the needed
paths to NaCl.
