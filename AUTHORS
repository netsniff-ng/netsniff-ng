Notes:

The order of authors with > 30 commits listed here is sorted by contributions
from high to low through ``git log --no-merges $@ | grep Author: | \
cut -d: -f2 | cut -d\< -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r''. The list of minor
contributors is currently unsorted and contains people who have contributed
code ``in some way'' (e.g. on the upstream or maintenance repositories), either
through Git or email.

Note that we have taken over the maintenance and further development of Herbert
Haas' mausezahn [ˈmauzəˌtsa:n] utility after he passed away in 2011. There were
no Git commit statistics available from the import of his project. (*)

Want to join the core team? Submit enough great patches over a long time,
implement what's on the TODO file and show an ongoing, active interest in
supporting netsniff-ng. What's in for you? If you ever come to Switzerland,
you get a free beer on Daniel and you can meet some great people involved in
this project. ;)
