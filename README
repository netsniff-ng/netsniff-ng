The gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet
reception and transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel
space to user space and vice versa.

The netsniff-ng toolkit can be used for network development and analysis,
debugging, auditing or network reconnaissance. It currently consists of the
following utilities:

  * netsniff-ng: a zero-copy packet analyzer, pcap capturing/replaying tool
  * trafgen: a zero-copy network packet generator
  * mausezahn: packet generator and analyzer for HW/SW appliances with Cisco-CLI
  * ifpps: a top-like kernel networking and system statistics tool
  * curvetun: a lightweight curve25519-based multiuser IP tunnel
  * astraceroute: an autonomous system trace route and DPI testing utility
  * flowtop: a top-like netfilter connection tracking tool
  * bpfc: a tiny Berkeley Packet Filter compiler with Linux extensions

Have a look at the Documentation/ folder for further information, also at known
issues under Documentation/KnownIssues. Carefully read the INSTALL document for
the next steps in building netsniff-ng.

The netsniff-ng toolkit is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General 
Public License. For any questions or feedback about netsniff-ng you are welcome
to leave us a message to <workgroup@netsniff-ng.org> or to our mailing list
at <netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com> (Note: you have to register first).
netsniff-ng is purely non-profit and provided in the hope, that it is found
useful. The current project status can be considered as "working". In general,
all tools have been tested by us to a great extend including their command-line
options. In fact, many of our tools are used in production systems. However, we
give no guarantee that our tools are free of bugs! If you spot some issues,
contact us as described in REPORTING-BUGS. Also, have a look at our FAQ [2] for
answering your questions. This project has received support from institutions
listed in Documentation/Sponsors.

Happy packet hacking!
