For reporting bugs send an email to the <netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com> list.

Alternatively, you can create an issue on our Github project:

  * https://github.com/netsniff-ng/netsniff-ng/issues

If you use Fedora or have a RHEL subscription, you can also report bugs to:

  * https://bugzilla.redhat.com/

If you use Debian Linux, we might also process / track bugs there:

  * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=netsniff-ng

In any way, you'll get a reply from us. Please do not contact individual
developers directly in case of netsniff-ng issues or patches, but rather
always our mailing list. By this, you're not wasting time of a single
developer and increase your chances of getting a reply from us.

In general, we are also highly interested in how you use the toolkit, what
problems you are trying to solve and what kind of things you would like to have
improved. So feel free to drop us some feature requests as well.
